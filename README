NAME
    Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile - Read and modify ssh's authorized_keys
    files

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile;

            # Reads $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys by default
        my $akf = Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile->new();

            # Iterate over entries
        for my $key ($akf->keys()) {
            print $key->keylen(), "\n";
        }

            # Modify entries:
        for my $key ($akf->keys()) {
            $key->option("from", 'quack@quack.com');
            $key->keylen(1025);
        }
            # Save changes back to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
        $akf->save();

DESCRIPTION
    Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile reads and modifies "authorized_keys" files.
    "authorized_keys" files contain public keys and meta information to be
    used by "ssh" on the remote host to let users in without having to type
    their password.

METHODS
    "new"
        Creates a new Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile object and reads in the
        authorized_keys file. The filename defaults to
        "$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys" unless overridden with

            Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile->new( file => "/path/other_authkeys_file" );

    "keys"
        Returns a list of Net::SSH::AuthorizedKey objects. Methods are
        described in Net::SSH::AuthorizedKey.

    "as_string"
        String representation of all keys, ultimately the content that gets
        written out when calling the "save()" method. Note that comments
        from the original file are lost.

    "save"
        Write changes back to the authorized_keys file using the as_string()
        method described above. Note that comments from the original file
        are lost. Optionally takes a file name parameter, so calling
        "$akf->save("foo.txt")" will save the data in the file "foo.txt"
        instead of the file the data was read from originally.
