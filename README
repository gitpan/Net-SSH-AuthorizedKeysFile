            options  => { from => 'foo@bar.com', "no-agent-forwarding" },
            key      => "123....890",

DESCRIPTION
    Net::SSH::AuthorizedKey objects holds key lines from ssh's
    authorized_keys files. They just provide getter/setter methods.

METHODS
    "option"
        Get/set an option. Note that options can be either binary or carry a
        string:

                # Set "no-agent-forwarding" option
            $ak->option("no-agent-forwarding", 1);

                # Check if no-agent-forwarding option is set
            if($ak->option("no-agent-forwarding")) {
                # ...
            }

                # Set the from option to 'from="a@b.com"'
            $ak->option(from => 'a@b.com');

                # Get the value of the 'from' option
            my $val = $ak->option("from");

    "option_delete"
        Remove an option completely. "$ak->option_delete("from")" will
        remove the "from" option from the key meta info.

    "type"
        Type of ssh key, either "ssh-1" or "ssh-2".

    "email"
        Email address of the person who created the key. (Different from the
        "from" option).

    "key"
        Public key, either a long number (ssh-1) or a line of alphanumeric
        characters.

    "keylen"
        Length of the key in bit (e.g. 1024).

    "exponent"
        Two-digit number in front of the key in ssh-1 keys.

    Calling a method will return "undef" if the corresponding entry doesn't
    exist in the key meta data.
